# TileDimension

A shaderpack that makes all terrain textures appear as if they are a windows into a tiled verison of that texture!
This shaderpack is based on [XorDevs-Default-Shaderpack](https://github.com/XorDev/XorDevs-Default-Shaderpack).

The shaderpack uses all shaders from XorDev's shaderpack but adds:
gbuffer_terrain.vsh
gbuffer_terrain.fsh
